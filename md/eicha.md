Chapter 1

אֵיכָ֣ה ׀ יָשְׁבָ֣ה בָדָ֗ד 

How solitary does she sit, 

הָעִיר֙ רַבָּ֣תִי עָ֔ם

the city [formerly] rich in people. 

הָיְתָ֖ה כְּאַלְמָנָ֑ה 

She has become like a widow. 

רַבָּ֣תִי בַגּוֹיִ֗ם 

The great among the nations, 

שָׂרָ֙תִי֙ בַּמְּדִינ֔וֹת 

the princess of the provinces, 

הָיְתָ֖ה לָמַֽס׃ {ס}        

has become tributary.

בָּכ֨וֹ תִבְכֶּ֜ה בַּלַּ֗יְלָה וְדִמְעָתָהּ֙ עַ֣ל לֶֽחֱיָ֔הּ אֵֽין־לָ֥הּ מְנַחֵ֖ם מִכׇּל־אֹהֲבֶ֑יהָ כׇּל־רֵעֶ֙יהָ֙ בָּ֣גְדוּ בָ֔הּ הָ֥יוּ לָ֖הּ לְאֹיְבִֽים׃ {ס}        
She weeps, she weeps [(two "weepings" for two Temples)] at night [(the Temple having been destroyed at night)], and her tears are on her cheeks [(with constant weeping)]. She has no consolers of all her lovers. All her lovers have betrayed her; they have become foes to her.

גָּֽלְתָ֨ה יְהוּדָ֤ה מֵעֹ֙נִי֙ וּמֵרֹ֣ב עֲבֹדָ֔ה הִ֚יא יָשְׁבָ֣ה בַגּוֹיִ֔ם לֹ֥א מָצְאָ֖ה מָנ֑וֹחַ כׇּל־רֹדְפֶ֥יהָ הִשִּׂיג֖וּהָ בֵּ֥ין הַמְּצָרִֽים׃ {ס}        
Judah has gone into exile from affliction and from much servitude [(of the Kasdim.)] She sat among the nations, (but) found no rest. All of her pursuers overtook her between the straits.

דַּרְכֵ֨י צִיּ֜וֹן אֲבֵל֗וֹת מִבְּלִי֙ בָּאֵ֣י מוֹעֵ֔ד כׇּל־שְׁעָרֶ֙יהָ֙ שֽׁוֹמֵמִ֔ין כֹּהֲנֶ֖יהָ נֶאֱנָחִ֑ים בְּתוּלֹתֶ֥יהָ נּוּג֖וֹת וְהִ֥יא מַר־לָֽהּ׃ {ס}        
The ways of Zion mourn, without the festival-pilgrims. All of her gates are desolate; her priests sigh; her virgins are afflicted; and she is bitter unto herself.

הָי֨וּ צָרֶ֤יהָ לְרֹאשׁ֙ אֹיְבֶ֣יהָ שָׁל֔וּ כִּֽי־יְהֹוָ֥ה הוֹגָ֖הּ עַ֣ל רֹב־פְּשָׁעֶ֑יהָ עוֹלָלֶ֛יהָ הָלְכ֥וּ שְׁבִ֖י לִפְנֵי־צָֽר׃ {ס}        
Her adversaries have become the heads; her foes have prospered. For the L-rd has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions. Her young children are gone captive before the enemy.

וַיֵּצֵ֥א (מן בת) [מִבַּת־]צִיּ֖וֹן כׇּל־הֲדָרָ֑הּ הָי֣וּ שָׂרֶ֗יהָ כְּאַיָּלִים֙ לֹא־מָצְא֣וּ מִרְעֶ֔ה וַיֵּלְכ֥וּ בְלֹא־כֹ֖חַ לִפְנֵ֥י רוֹדֵֽף׃ {ס}        
And there went forth from the daughter of Zion all of her splendor. Her princes have become like harts not finding pasture, and they have gone without strength before the pursuer.

זָֽכְרָ֣ה יְרוּשָׁלַ֗͏ִם יְמֵ֤י עׇנְיָהּ֙ וּמְרוּדֶ֔יהָ כֹּ֚ל מַחֲמֻדֶ֔יהָ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָי֖וּ מִ֣ימֵי קֶ֑דֶם בִּנְפֹ֧ל עַמָּ֣הּ בְּיַד־צָ֗ר וְאֵ֤ין עוֹזֵר֙ לָ֔הּ רָא֣וּהָ צָרִ֔ים שָׂחֲק֖וּ עַ֥ל מִשְׁבַּתֶּֽהָ׃ {ס}        
Jerusalem [(i.e., the daughter of Zion in her exile)] remembered the days of [her destruction which led to] her affliction and her grieving. [She remembered] all of her precious things which she enjoyed in days of yore. When her people fell into the hand of the oppressor, with none to help her, oppressors beheld her and rejoiced at her cessations [(the cessations of her joyous festivals, New Moons, and Sabbaths)].

חֵ֤טְא חָֽטְאָה֙ יְר֣וּשָׁלַ֔͏ִם עַל־כֵּ֖ן לְנִידָ֣ה הָיָ֑תָה כׇּֽל־מְכַבְּדֶ֤יהָ הִזִּיל֙וּהָ֙ כִּי־רָא֣וּ עֶרְוָתָ֔הּ גַּם־הִ֥יא נֶאֶנְחָ֖ה וַתָּ֥שׇׁב אָחֽוֹר׃ {ס}        
A sin has Jerusalem sinned; she has, therefore, been made an exile. All who honored her cheapened her, for they saw her shame; she herself sighed and recoiled.

טֻמְאָתָ֣הּ בְּשׁוּלֶ֗יהָ לֹ֤א זָֽכְרָה֙ אַחֲרִיתָ֔הּ וַתֵּ֣רֶד פְּלָאִ֔ים אֵ֥ין מְנַחֵ֖ם לָ֑הּ רְאֵ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־עׇנְיִ֔י כִּ֥י הִגְדִּ֖יל אוֹיֵֽב׃ {ס}        
Her blood was on her skirts [i.e., she sinned openly]. She did not bethink herself of her latter end, wherefore she has fallen awesomely, with none to console her. See, O L-rd, my affliction, for the foe has grown bold.

יָדוֹ֙ פָּ֣רַשׂ צָ֔ר עַ֖ל כׇּל־מַחֲמַדֶּ֑יהָ כִּֽי־רָאֲתָ֤ה גוֹיִם֙ בָּ֣אוּ מִקְדָּשָׁ֔הּ אֲשֶׁ֣ר צִוִּ֔יתָה לֹא־יָבֹ֥אוּ בַקָּהָ֖ל לָֽךְ׃ {ס}        
The foe [(Ammon and Moav)] has stretched out his hand against all her precious things [(Torah scrolls)]. For she has seen nations entering her sanctuary, concerning whom You commanded [viz. Deuteronomy 23:4]: They may not enter the congregation [(of Israel)] unto you.

כׇּל־עַמָּ֤הּ נֶאֱנָחִים֙ מְבַקְשִׁ֣ים לֶ֔חֶם נָתְנ֧וּ (מחמודיהם) [מַחֲמַדֵּיהֶ֛ם] בְּאֹ֖כֶל לְהָשִׁ֣יב נָ֑פֶשׁ רְאֵ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ וְֽהַבִּ֔יטָה כִּ֥י הָיִ֖יתִי זוֹלֵלָֽה׃ {ס}        
All her people sigh, seeking bread. They have given their precious things for food to restore their souls. See, O L-rd, and look upon it, how I have been cheapened.

ל֣וֹא אֲלֵיכֶם֮ כׇּל־עֹ֣בְרֵי דֶ֒רֶךְ֒ הַבִּ֣יטוּ וּרְא֗וּ אִם־יֵ֤שׁ מַכְאוֹב֙ כְּמַכְאֹבִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר עוֹלַ֖ל לִ֑י אֲשֶׁר֙ הוֹגָ֣ה יְהֹוָ֔ה בְּי֖וֹם חֲר֥וֹן אַפּֽוֹ׃ {ס}        
May [such woe] nevermore [be inflicted upon] all who transgress the way [i.e., the ordinance of the L-rd]! Look and see if there is a pain like my pain that has been wrought unto me, which the L-rd inflicted (upon me) in the day of His wrath.

מִמָּר֛וֹם שָֽׁלַח־אֵ֥שׁ בְּעַצְמֹתַ֖י וַיִּרְדֶּ֑נָּה פָּרַ֨שׂ רֶ֤שֶׁת לְרַגְלַי֙ הֱשִׁיבַ֣נִי אָח֔וֹר נְתָנַ֙נִי֙ שֹֽׁמֵמָ֔ה כׇּל־הַיּ֖וֹם דָּוָֽה׃ {ס}        
From the heights He sent fire against my bones, and He has overmastered [(and broken them)]. He has spread a net for my feet. He has set me back. He has made me desolate, faint all the day.

נִשְׂקַד֩ עֹ֨ל פְּשָׁעַ֜י בְּיָד֗וֹ יִשְׂתָּ֥רְג֛וּ עָל֥וּ עַל־צַוָּארִ֖י הִכְשִׁ֣יל כֹּחִ֑י נְתָנַ֣נִי אֲדֹנָ֔י בִּידֵ֖י לֹא־אוּכַ֥ל קֽוּם׃ {ס}        
The yoke of my offenses has become spotted in His hand [i.e., each of them has become an indelible spot before Him]. They have intermixed and come up upon my neck. My strength has failed. The L-rd has delivered me into the hands of [one against whom] I cannot rise.

סִלָּ֨ה כׇל־אַבִּירַ֤י ׀ אֲדֹנָי֙ בְּקִרְבִּ֔י קָרָ֥א עָלַ֛י מוֹעֵ֖ד לִשְׁבֹּ֣ר בַּחוּרָ֑י גַּ֚ת דָּרַ֣ךְ אֲדֹנָ֔י לִבְתוּלַ֖ת בַּת־יְהוּדָֽה׃ {ס}        
The L-rd has trodden down all my mighty ones in my midst. He has called out a host against me to break my young men. As a winepress did the L-rd tread the virgin daughter of Judah.

עַל־אֵ֣לֶּה ׀ אֲנִ֣י בוֹכִיָּ֗ה עֵינִ֤י ׀ עֵינִי֙ יֹ֣רְדָה מַּ֔יִם כִּֽי־רָחַ֥ק מִמֶּ֛נִּי מְנַחֵ֖ם מֵשִׁ֣יב נַפְשִׁ֑י הָי֤וּ בָנַי֙ שֽׁוֹמֵמִ֔ים כִּ֥י גָבַ֖ר אוֹיֵֽב׃ {ס}        
Over these I weep. My eye, my eye, [endlessly] sheds water; for consolation is far from me, the restorer of my soul. My children are become desolate, for the foe has grown strong.

פֵּֽרְשָׂ֨ה צִיּ֜וֹן בְּיָדֶ֗יהָ אֵ֤ין מְנַחֵם֙ לָ֔הּ צִוָּ֧ה יְהֹוָ֛ה לְיַעֲקֹ֖ב סְבִיבָ֣יו צָרָ֑יו הָיְתָ֧ה יְרוּשָׁלַ֛͏ִם לְנִדָּ֖ה בֵּינֵיהֶֽם׃ {ס}        
Zion has spread out her hands [(in agony)]; there is none to console her. The L-rd has commanded against Jacob his foes roundabout him. [(Even when they were exiled to Bavel and Ashur, Sancherev exiled their foes, Ammon and Moav, and settled them around them to harass them.)] Jerusalem has become an outcast among them.

צַדִּ֥יק ה֛וּא יְהֹוָ֖ה כִּ֣י פִ֣יהוּ מָרִ֑יתִי שִׁמְעוּ־נָ֣א כׇל־[הָֽעַמִּ֗ים] (עמים) וּרְאוּ֙ מַכְאֹבִ֔י בְּתוּלֹתַ֥י וּבַחוּרַ֖י הָלְכ֥וּ בַשֶּֽׁבִי׃ {ס}        
Righteous is the L-rd, for I have rebelled against His word. Hear, I pray you, all the peoples, and see my pain. My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.

קָרָ֤אתִי לַֽמְאַהֲבַי֙ הֵ֣מָּה רִמּ֔וּנִי כֹּהֲנַ֥י וּזְקֵנַ֖י בָּעִ֣יר גָּוָ֑עוּ כִּֽי־בִקְשׁ֥וּ אֹ֙כֶל֙ לָ֔מוֹ וְיָשִׁ֖יבוּ אֶת־נַפְשָֽׁם׃ {ס}        
I called [(those who appeared to be)] my lovers; they deceived me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while seeking bread for themselves wherewith to restore their souls.

רְאֵ֨ה יְהֹוָ֤ה כִּֽי־צַר־לִי֙ מֵעַ֣י חֳמַרְמָ֔רוּ נֶהְפַּ֤ךְ לִבִּי֙ בְּקִרְבִּ֔י כִּ֥י מָר֖וֹ מָרִ֑יתִי מִח֥וּץ שִׁכְּלָה־חֶ֖רֶב בַּבַּ֥יִת כַּמָּֽוֶת׃ {ס}        
See, O L-rd, that I am afflicted; my innards are shriveled. My heart is overturned in my midst, for I have deeply rebelled. Outside, the sword bereaved; inside [it was] like death.

שָׁמְע֞וּ כִּ֧י נֶאֱנָחָ֣ה אָ֗נִי אֵ֤ין מְנַחֵם֙ לִ֔י כׇּל־אֹ֨יְבַ֜י שָׁמְע֤וּ רָֽעָתִי֙ שָׂ֔שׂוּ כִּ֥י אַתָּ֖ה עָשִׂ֑יתָ הֵבֵ֥אתָ יוֹם־קָרָ֖אתָ וְיִֽהְי֥וּ כָמֹֽנִי׃ {ס}        
They have heard how I sigh, but none console me. All of my foes have heard of my evil. They have rejoiced, for You have wrought (it) [i.e., You have caused them to hate me by forbidding me to intermingle with them]. Would that you brought [upon them] the day [(of destruction)] that You called out [upon me], that they be as I.

תָּבֹ֨א כׇל־רָעָתָ֤ם לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙ וְעוֹלֵ֣ל לָ֔מוֹ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר עוֹלַ֛לְתָּ לִ֖י עַ֣ל כׇּל־פְּשָׁעָ֑י כִּֽי־רַבּ֥וֹת אַנְחֹתַ֖י וְלִבִּ֥י דַוָּֽי׃ {פ}
Let all their evil come [(in remembrance)] before You, and do to them as You have done to me for all of my offenses; for my sighs are many and my heart is faint.


Chapter 2

אֵיכָה֩ יָעִ֨יב בְּאַפּ֤וֹ ׀ אֲדֹנָי֙ אֶת־בַּת־צִיּ֔וֹן הִשְׁלִ֤יךְ מִשָּׁמַ֙יִם֙ אֶ֔רֶץ תִּפְאֶ֖רֶת יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְלֹא־זָכַ֥ר הֲדֹם־רַגְלָ֖יו בְּי֥וֹם אַפּֽוֹ׃ {ס}        
How the L-rd has beclouded in His wrath the daughter of Zion! He has cast down from heaven to earth the glory of Israel and not remembered His footstool [(the Temple)] in the day of His wrath.

בִּלַּ֨ע אֲדֹנָ֜י (לא) [וְלֹ֣א] חָמַ֗ל אֵ֚ת כׇּל־נְא֣וֹת יַעֲקֹ֔ב הָרַ֧ס בְּעֶבְרָת֛וֹ מִבְצְרֵ֥י בַת־יְהוּדָ֖ה הִגִּ֣יעַ לָאָ֑רֶץ חִלֵּ֥ל מַמְלָכָ֖ה וְשָׂרֶֽיהָ׃ {ס}        
The L-rd has swallowed up without pity all the habitations of Jacob. He has destroyed in His wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He has brought them down to the ground. He has profaned the kingdom [(Israel, "a kingdom of priests")] and its princes.

גָּדַ֣ע בׇּֽחֳרִי־אַ֗ף כֹּ֚ל קֶ֣רֶן יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל הֵשִׁ֥יב אָח֛וֹר יְמִינ֖וֹ מִפְּנֵ֣י אוֹיֵ֑ב וַיִּבְעַ֤ר בְּיַעֲקֹב֙ כְּאֵ֣שׁ לֶֽהָבָ֔ה אָכְלָ֖ה סָבִֽיב׃ {ס}        
He has cut off in burning wrath all the glory of Israel. He has drawn back His right hand [(from the defense of Israel] from before the foe; and He has burned against Jacob as a flaming fire, devouring roundabout.

דָּרַ֨ךְ קַשְׁתּ֜וֹ כְּאוֹיֵ֗ב נִצָּ֤ב יְמִינוֹ֙ כְּצָ֔ר וַֽיַּהֲרֹ֔ג כֹּ֖ל מַחֲמַדֵּי־עָ֑יִן בְּאֹ֙הֶל֙ בַּת־צִיּ֔וֹן שָׁפַ֥ךְ כָּאֵ֖שׁ חֲמָתֽוֹ׃ {ס}        
He has drawn His bow as an enemy; He has set His right hand as an oppressor, and He has slain all that delighted the eye in the tent of the daughter of Zion. He has spilled out His fire-like wrath.

הָיָ֨ה אֲדֹנָ֤י ׀ כְּאוֹיֵב֙ בִּלַּ֣ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בִּלַּע֙ כׇּל־אַרְמְנוֹתֶ֔יהָ שִׁחֵ֖ת מִבְצָרָ֑יו וַיֶּ֙רֶב֙ בְּבַת־יְהוּדָ֔ה תַּאֲנִיָּ֖ה וַאֲנִיָּֽה׃ {ס}        
The L-rd has become like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all its palaces; He has destroyed its strongholds; and He has increased in the daughter [i.e., the congregation] of Judah affliction and wailing.

וַיַּחְמֹ֤ס כַּגַּן֙ שֻׂכּ֔וֹ שִׁחֵ֖ת מֹעֲד֑וֹ שִׁכַּ֨ח יְהֹוָ֤ה ׀ בְּצִיּוֹן֙ מוֹעֵ֣ד וְשַׁבָּ֔ת וַיִּנְאַ֥ץ בְּזַֽעַם־אַפּ֖וֹ מֶ֥לֶךְ וְכֹהֵֽן׃ {ס}        
And He has cut off His abode [(the Temple)] as [(one cuts the vegetables of)] a garden. He has destroyed His meeting place [(the holy of holies)]. The L-rd has caused to go forgotten in Zion festival and Sabbath; and He has cast out in the raging of His wrath, king [(Tzidkiyahu)] and [high-] priest [(Serayahu)].

זָנַ֨ח אֲדֹנָ֤י ׀ מִזְבְּחוֹ֙ נִאֵ֣ר מִקְדָּשׁ֔וֹ הִסְגִּיר֙ בְּיַד־אוֹיֵ֔ב חוֹמֹ֖ת אַרְמְנוֹתֶ֑יהָ ק֛וֹל נָתְנ֥וּ בְּבֵית־יְהֹוָ֖ה כְּי֥וֹם מוֹעֵֽד׃ {ס}        
The L-rd has voided His altar; He has abolished His sanctuary. He has handed over to the enemy the walls of her palaces. A shout did they raise in the house of the L-rd as on a festival day.

חָשַׁ֨ב יְהֹוָ֤ה ׀ לְהַשְׁחִית֙ חוֹמַ֣ת בַּת־צִיּ֔וֹן נָ֣טָה קָ֔ו לֹא־הֵשִׁ֥יב יָד֖וֹ מִבַּלֵּ֑עַ וַיַּֽאֲבֶל־חֵ֥ל וְחוֹמָ֖ה יַחְדָּ֥ו אֻמְלָֽלוּ׃ {ס}        
The L-rd had [long] thought to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. He stretched out a line [(of judgment)]; He did not draw back His hand from swallowing up. And He cast into mourning rampart and wall; together did they languish.

טָבְע֤וּ בָאָ֙רֶץ֙ שְׁעָרֶ֔יהָ אִבַּ֥ד וְשִׁבַּ֖ר בְּרִיחֶ֑יהָ מַלְכָּ֨הּ וְשָׂרֶ֤יהָ בַגּוֹיִם֙ אֵ֣ין תּוֹרָ֔ה גַּם־נְבִיאֶ֕יהָ לֹא־מָצְא֥וּ חָז֖וֹן מֵיְהֹוָֽה׃ {ס}        
Her gates are sunk in the ground. He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her kings and her princes [are] among the nations devoid of instruction. Her prophets, too, have not found a vision from the L-rd.

יֵשְׁב֨וּ לָאָ֤רֶץ יִדְּמוּ֙ זִקְנֵ֣י בַת־צִיּ֔וֹן הֶֽעֱל֤וּ עָפָר֙ עַל־רֹאשָׁ֔ם חָגְר֖וּ שַׂקִּ֑ים הוֹרִ֤ידוּ לָאָ֙רֶץ֙ רֹאשָׁ֔ן בְּתוּלֹ֖ת יְרוּשָׁלָֽ͏ִם׃ {ס}        
They have sat upon the ground; they have been silent, the elders of the daughters of Zion. They have cast dust upon their heads; they have donned sackcloth. They bent their heads to the ground, the virgins of Jerusalem.

כָּל֨וּ בַדְּמָע֤וֹת עֵינַי֙ חֳמַרְמְר֣וּ מֵעַ֔י נִשְׁפַּ֤ךְ לָאָ֙רֶץ֙ כְּבֵדִ֔י עַל־שֶׁ֖בֶר בַּת־עַמִּ֑י בֵּֽעָטֵ֤ף עוֹלֵל֙ וְיוֹנֵ֔ק בִּרְחֹב֖וֹת קִרְיָֽה׃ {ס}        
My eyes have failed with tears; my innards have shriveled up; my liver is poured upon the ground over the breaking of the daughter of my people, over the languishing of child and suckling in the streets of the city.

לְאִמֹּתָם֙ יֹֽאמְר֔וּ אַיֵּ֖ה דָּגָ֣ן וָיָ֑יִן בְּהִֽתְעַטְּפָ֤ם כֶּֽחָלָל֙ בִּרְחֹב֣וֹת עִ֔יר בְּהִשְׁתַּפֵּ֣ךְ נַפְשָׁ֔ם אֶל־חֵ֖יק אִמֹּתָֽם׃ {ס}        
To their mothers they say: Where is corn and wine, expiring as a slain one in the streets of the city, spilling out their souls at their mothers' bosom.

מָֽה־אֲעִידֵ֞ךְ מָ֣ה אֲדַמֶּה־לָּ֗ךְ הַבַּת֙ יְר֣וּשָׁלַ֔͏ִם מָ֤ה אַשְׁוֶה־לָּךְ֙ וַאֲנַֽחֲמֵ֔ךְ בְּתוּלַ֖ת בַּת־צִיּ֑וֹן כִּֽי־גָד֥וֹל כַּיָּ֛ם שִׁבְרֵ֖ךְ מִ֥י יִרְפָּא־לָֽךְ׃ {ס}        
What testimony shall I bring for you? What shall I compare to you? [(saying: Why are you amazed over your destruction? Did the same not happen to this and this nation?)] What shall I liken to you to console you [(saying: the very same thing happened to so and so)], O virgin daughter of Zion? For great as the sea is your breaking — Who shall heal you?

נְבִיאַ֗יִךְ חָ֤זוּ לָךְ֙ שָׁ֣וְא וְתָפֵ֔ל וְלֹֽא־גִלּ֥וּ עַל־עֲוֺנֵ֖ךְ לְהָשִׁ֣יב (שביתך) [שְׁבוּתֵ֑ךְ] וַיֶּ֣חֱזוּ לָ֔ךְ מַשְׂא֥וֹת שָׁ֖וְא וּמַדּוּחִֽים׃ {ס}        
Your prophets prophesied for you vanity and folly, and they did not expose [and chastise you for] your iniquity to turn back your backsliding. And they prophesied for you burdens of vanity and recalcitrance [(against the L-rd)].

סָֽפְק֨וּ עָלַ֤יִךְ כַּפַּ֙יִם֙ כׇּל־עֹ֣בְרֵי דֶ֔רֶךְ שָֽׁרְקוּ֙ וַיָּנִ֣עוּ רֹאשָׁ֔ם עַל־בַּ֖ת יְרוּשָׁלָ֑͏ִם הֲזֹ֣את הָעִ֗יר שֶׁיֹּֽאמְרוּ֙ כְּלִ֣ילַת יֹ֔פִי מָשׂ֖וֹשׂ לְכׇל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃ {ס}        
All the wayfarers clapped their hands over you. They whistled [in astonishment] and shook their heads over the daughter of Jerusalem: Is this the city of which it was said: "the sum of beauty, the joy of all the earth"?

פָּצ֨וּ עָלַ֤יִךְ פִּיהֶם֙ כׇּל־אֹ֣יְבַ֔יִךְ שָֽׁרְקוּ֙ וַיַּֽחַרְקוּ־שֵׁ֔ן אָמְר֖וּ בִּלָּ֑עְנוּ אַ֣ךְ זֶ֥ה הַיּ֛וֹם שֶׁקִּוִּינֻ֖הוּ מָצָ֥אנוּ רָאִֽינוּ׃ {ס}        
They opened their mouths against you, all of your enemies. They hissed and gnashed their teeth. They said: We have swallowed her up. Truly, this is the day that we waited for. We have found it. We have seen it.

עָשָׂ֨ה יְהֹוָ֜ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר זָמָ֗ם בִּצַּ֤ע אֶמְרָתוֹ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר צִוָּ֣ה מִֽימֵי־קֶ֔דֶם הָרַ֖ס וְלֹ֣א חָמָ֑ל וַיְשַׂמַּ֤ח עָלַ֙יִךְ֙ אוֹיֵ֔ב הֵרִ֖ים קֶ֥רֶן צָרָֽיִךְ׃ {ס}        
The L-rd has wrought what He devised. He consummated His word which He pronounced in days of yore [viz. Leviticus 26:18]. He has destroyed and not pitied. And He has caused the foe to rejoice over you; He has lifted the horn of your oppressors.

צָעַ֥ק לִבָּ֖ם אֶל־אֲדֹנָ֑י חוֹמַ֣ת בַּת־צִ֠יּ֠וֹן הוֹרִ֨ידִי כַנַּ֤חַל דִּמְעָה֙ יוֹמָ֣ם וָלַ֔יְלָה אַֽל־תִּתְּנִ֤י פוּגַת֙ לָ֔ךְ אַל־תִּדֹּ֖ם בַּת־עֵינֵֽךְ׃ {ס}        
Their [(Israel's)] heart cried out to the L-rd: O wall of the daughter of Zion, shed tears like a stream day and night! Give yourself no respite! Let the pupil of your eye not be still!

ק֣וּמִי ׀ רֹ֣נִּי (בליל) [בַלַּ֗יְלָה] לְרֹאשׁ֙ אַשְׁמֻר֔וֹת שִׁפְכִ֤י כַמַּ֙יִם֙ לִבֵּ֔ךְ נֹ֖כַח פְּנֵ֣י אֲדֹנָ֑י שְׂאִ֧י אֵלָ֣יו כַּפַּ֗יִךְ עַל־נֶ֙פֶשׁ֙ עֽוֹלָלַ֔יִךְ הָעֲטוּפִ֥ים בְּרָעָ֖ב בְּרֹ֥אשׁ כׇּל־חוּצֽוֹת׃ {ס}        
Arise, cry out in the night, at the start of [(the last two)] of the [(three night-)] watches. Spill out your heart as water before the presence of the L-rd. Lift your hands to Him for the Lives of your young ones, who languish with hunger at the head of every street.

רְאֵ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ וְֽהַבִּ֔יטָה לְמִ֖י עוֹלַ֣לְתָּ כֹּ֑ה אִם־תֹּאכַ֨לְנָה נָשִׁ֤ים פִּרְיָם֙ עֹלְלֵ֣י טִפֻּחִ֔ים אִם־יֵהָרֵ֛ג בְּמִקְדַּ֥שׁ אֲדֹנָ֖י כֹּהֵ֥ן וְנָבִֽיא׃ {ס}        
See, O L-rd, and behold: To whom have You wrought thus? Shall women eat their fruit? their fondled young ones? Shall there be killed in the sanctuary of the L-rd, priest and prophet?

שָׁכְב֨וּ לָאָ֤רֶץ חוּצוֹת֙ נַ֣עַר וְזָקֵ֔ן בְּתוּלֹתַ֥י וּבַחוּרַ֖י נָפְל֣וּ בֶחָ֑רֶב הָרַ֙גְתָּ֙ בְּי֣וֹם אַפֶּ֔ךָ טָבַ֖חְתָּ לֹ֥א חָמָֽלְתָּ׃ {ס}        
They lay on the ground in the streets, young and old. My virgins and my young men fell by the sword. You killed on the day of Your wrath; You slaughtered; You did not pity.

תִּקְרָא֩ כְי֨וֹם מוֹעֵ֤ד מְגוּרַי֙ מִסָּבִ֔יב וְלֹ֥א הָיָ֛ה בְּי֥וֹם אַף־יְהֹוָ֖ה פָּלִ֣יט וְשָׂרִ֑יד אֲשֶׁר־טִפַּ֥חְתִּי וְרִבִּ֖יתִי אֹיְבִ֥י כִלָּֽם׃ {פ}
You have called, as on a festival day, my [evil] neighbors roundabout [to participate in the slaughter], and there remained not on the day of the L-rd's wrath a survivor or a remnant. Those [(children)] whom I fondled and reared, my foe destroyed.


Chapter 3

אֲנִ֤י הַגֶּ֙בֶר֙ רָאָ֣ה עֳנִ֔י בְּשֵׁ֖בֶט עֶבְרָתֽוֹ׃ {ס}        
I [(Jeremiah, am the prophet who)] has seen affliction [(i.e., the destruction of the Temple), more so than any other prophet who foretold it (it not having taken place in their days, but in mine)], by the rod of His wrath.

אוֹתִ֥י נָהַ֛ג וַיֹּלַ֖ךְ חֹ֥שֶׁךְ וְלֹא־אֽוֹר׃ {ס}        
He has led me, and He has brought [me into] darkness and not light.

אַ֣ךְ בִּ֥י יָשֻׁ֛ב יַהֲפֹ֥ךְ יָד֖וֹ כׇּל־הַיּֽוֹם׃ {ס}        
Only against me does He renew [His blows], turning His hand [against me] all the day.

בִּלָּ֤ה בְשָׂרִי֙ וְעוֹרִ֔י שִׁבַּ֖ר עַצְמוֹתָֽי׃ {ס}        
He has worn away my flesh and my skin. He has broken my bones.

בָּנָ֥ה עָלַ֛י וַיַּקַּ֖ף רֹ֥אשׁ וּתְלָאָֽה׃ {ס}        
He has built [(mounds)] upon me and has encompassed me with gall and woe.

בְּמַחֲשַׁכִּ֥ים הוֹשִׁיבַ֖נִי כְּמֵתֵ֥י עוֹלָֽם׃ {ס}        
In darkness did He seat me, as the dead of yore.

גָּדַ֧ר בַּעֲדִ֛י וְלֹ֥א אֵצֵ֖א הִכְבִּ֥יד נְחׇשְׁתִּֽי׃ {ס}        
He has fenced me about; I cannot escape. He has weighted down my [foot] with shackles.

גַּ֣ם כִּ֤י אֶזְעַק֙ וַאֲשַׁוֵּ֔עַ שָׂתַ֖ם תְּפִלָּתִֽי׃ {ס}        
Though I call and cry out, He closes up [(the "windows of heaven" to)] my prayer.

גָּדַ֤ר דְּרָכַי֙ בְּגָזִ֔ית נְתִיבֹתַ֖י עִוָּֽה׃ {ס}        
He has blocked my ways with hewn stones; He has made my paths crooked [(by blocking the roads)].

דֹּ֣ב אֹרֵ֥ב הוּא֙ לִ֔י (אריה) [אֲרִ֖י] בְּמִסְתָּרִֽים׃ {ס}        
He has become a bear in ambush to me; a lion in the covert.

דְּרָכַ֥י סוֹרֵ֛ר וַֽיְפַשְּׁחֵ֖נִי שָׂמַ֥נִי שֹׁמֵֽם׃ {ס}        
He has turned aside my ways and straitened my strides; He has made me desolate.

דָּרַ֤ךְ קַשְׁתּוֹ֙ וַיַּצִּיבֵ֔נִי כַּמַּטָּרָ֖א לַחֵֽץ׃ {ס}        
He has bent His bow and set me up as a target for the arrow.

הֵבִיא֙ בְּכִלְיֹתָ֔י בְּנֵ֖י אַשְׁפָּתֽוֹ׃ {ס}        
He has brought into my reins the "sons of His quiver" [i.e., His arrows].

הָיִ֤יתִי שְּׂחֹק֙ לְכׇל־עַמִּ֔י נְגִינָתָ֖ם כׇּל־הַיּֽוֹם׃ {ס}        
I was a mockery to all my people, their song the entire day.

הִשְׂבִּיעַ֥נִי בַמְּרוֹרִ֖ים הִרְוַ֥נִי לַעֲנָֽה׃ {ס}        
He has sated me with bitterness; He has glutted me with wormwood.

וַיַּגְרֵ֤ס בֶּֽחָצָץ֙ שִׁנָּ֔י הִכְפִּישַׁ֖נִי בָּאֵֽפֶר׃ {ס}        
He broke my teeth with gravel [(The exiles were constrained to knead their dough in the ground and earth particles adhered to it)]; He pressed me [i.e., my face] down to the dust.

וַתִּזְנַ֧ח מִשָּׁל֛וֹם נַפְשִׁ֖י נָשִׁ֥יתִי טוֹבָֽה׃ {ס}        
My soul was removed from peace; I forgot good.

וָאֹמַר֙ אָבַ֣ד נִצְחִ֔י וְתוֹחַלְתִּ֖י מֵיְהֹוָֽה׃ {ס}        
And I said: My world and my hope are lost from the L-rd.

זְכׇר־עָנְיִ֥י וּמְרוּדִ֖י לַעֲנָ֥ה וָרֹֽאשׁ׃ {ס}        
Remember my affliction and my plaint, wormwood and gall.

זָכ֣וֹר תִּזְכּ֔וֹר (ותשיח) [וְתָשׁ֥וֹחַ] עָלַ֖י נַפְשִֽׁי׃ {ס}        
My soul well remembers and is bowed down within me.

זֹ֛את אָשִׁ֥יב אֶל־לִבִּ֖י עַל־כֵּ֥ן אוֹחִֽיל׃ {ס}        
(But) this shall I return to my heart, and, therefore, I shall hope [again]:

חַֽסְדֵ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ כִּ֣י לֹא־תָ֔מְנוּ כִּ֥י לֹא־כָל֖וּ רַחֲמָֽיו׃ {ס}        
The lovingkindnesses of the L-rd do not cease, for His mercies are endless.

חֲדָשִׁים֙ לַבְּקָרִ֔ים רַבָּ֖ה אֱמוּנָתֶֽךָ׃ {ס}        
They renew themselves every morning; great is Your trust [(to fulfill Your assurances, and our trust in You to do so)].

חֶלְקִ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ אָמְרָ֣ה נַפְשִׁ֔י עַל־כֵּ֖ן אוֹחִ֥יל לֽוֹ׃ {ס}        
The L-rd is my portion, my soul has said; and, therefore, I shall trust in Him.

ט֤וֹב יְהֹוָה֙ לְקֹוָ֔ו לְנֶ֖פֶשׁ תִּדְרְשֶֽׁנּוּ׃ {ס}        
The L-rd is good to those who hope in him, to the soul that seeks Him.

ט֤וֹב וְיָחִיל֙ וְדוּמָ֔ם לִתְשׁוּעַ֖ת יְהֹוָֽה׃ {ס}        
It is good that one hope and await the salvation of the L-rd.

ט֣וֹב לַגֶּ֔בֶר כִּֽי־יִשָּׂ֥א עֹ֖ל בִּנְעוּרָֽיו׃ {ס}

יֵשֵׁ֤ב בָּדָד֙ וְיִדֹּ֔ם כִּ֥י נָטַ֖ל עָלָֽיו׃ {ס}        
Let him [(the mourner)] sit alone and await [(reprieve)], for He has imposed [the decree] upon him.

יִתֵּ֤ן בֶּֽעָפָר֙ פִּ֔יהוּ אוּלַ֖י יֵ֥שׁ תִּקְוָֽה׃ {ס}        
Let him place his mouth in the dust; perhaps there is hope.

יִתֵּ֧ן לְמַכֵּ֛הוּ לֶ֖חִי יִשְׂבַּ֥ע בְּחֶרְפָּֽה׃ {ס}        
Let him give his cheek to his smiter; let him take his fill of insult.

כִּ֣י לֹ֥א יִזְנַ֛ח לְעוֹלָ֖ם אֲדֹנָֽי׃ {ס}        
For the L-rd does not abandon (one) forever.

כִּ֣י אִם־הוֹגָ֔ה וְרִחַ֖ם כְּרֹ֥ב חֲסָדָֽיו׃ {ס}        
For if he sorrows [(over his sin)], He will pity (him) in the abundance of His lovingkindness.

כִּ֣י לֹ֤א עִנָּה֙ מִלִּבּ֔וֹ וַיַּגֶּ֖ה בְּנֵי־אִֽישׁ׃ {ס}        
For He does not afflict (men) from His heart [i.e., from His will] and cause men to sorrow [(but their suffering stems from their sins)].

לְדַכֵּא֙ תַּ֣חַת רַגְלָ֔יו כֹּ֖ל אֲסִ֥ירֵי אָֽרֶץ׃ {ס}        
[("For He does not afflict, etc.")] to humble under His feet all the bound ones of the earth,

לְהַטּוֹת֙ מִשְׁפַּט־גָּ֔בֶר נֶ֖גֶד פְּנֵ֥י עֶלְיֽוֹן׃ {ס}        
to turn aside a man's judgment before the face of the Most High,

לְעַוֵּ֤ת אָדָם֙ בְּרִיב֔וֹ אֲדֹנָ֖י לֹ֥א רָאָֽה׃ {ס}        
to subvert a man in his quarrel — the L-rd does not countenance [such things].

מִ֣י זֶ֤ה אָמַר֙ וַתֶּ֔הִי אֲדֹנָ֖י לֹ֥א צִוָּֽה׃ {ס}        
[(And if you would contend that all of these things are chance,)] who, then, would say [i.e., command] and it [(a thing)] be, [if] the L-rd did not command,

מִפִּ֤י עֶלְיוֹן֙ לֹ֣א תֵצֵ֔א הָרָע֖וֹת וְהַטּֽוֹב׃ {ס}        
[if] it did not come forth from the mouth of the Most High, [both] the bad and the good?

מַה־יִּתְאוֹנֵן֙ אָדָ֣ם חָ֔י גֶּ֖בֶר עַל־חֲטָאָֽו׃ {ס}        
What, then, should a living man complain of? — [Each] man [should complain] of his sins!

נַחְפְּשָׂ֤ה דְרָכֵ֙ינוּ֙ וְֽנַחְקֹ֔רָה וְנָשׁ֖וּבָה עַד־יְהֹוָֽה׃ {ס}        
Let us seek out our ways and search them out, and let us return to the L-rd!

נִשָּׂ֤א לְבָבֵ֙נוּ֙ אֶל־כַּפָּ֔יִם אֶל־אֵ֖ל בַּשָּׁמָֽיִם׃ {ס}        
Let us lift up our hearts [(in contrition)] with our palms [(in prayer)] to the Almighty in heaven!

נַ֤חְנוּ פָשַׁ֙עְנוּ֙ וּמָרִ֔ינוּ אַתָּ֖ה לֹ֥א סָלָֽחְתָּ׃ {ס}        
We have offended and rebelled [(as is our way)], [but] You have not forgiven [(as should be Your way)]!

סַכּ֤וֹתָה בָאַף֙ וַֽתִּרְדְּפֵ֔נוּ הָרַ֖גְתָּ לֹ֥א חָמָֽלְתָּ׃ {ס}        
You have covered [Yourself] with wrath [(as a partition between You and us)] and have pursued us [with it]. You killed; You did not pity.

סַכּ֤וֹתָה בֶֽעָנָן֙ לָ֔ךְ מֵעֲב֖וֹר תְּפִלָּֽה׃ {ס}        
You have covered Yourself with a cloud against the passing of prayer.

סְחִ֧י וּמָא֛וֹס תְּשִׂימֵ֖נוּ בְּקֶ֥רֶב הָעַמִּֽים׃ {ס}        
Repulsive and loathsome have You rendered us in the midst of the peoples.

פָּצ֥וּ עָלֵ֛ינוּ פִּיהֶ֖ם כׇּל־אֹיְבֵֽינוּ׃ {ס}        
They have opened their mouths against us, all of our foes.

פַּ֧חַד וָפַ֛חַת הָ֥יָה לָ֖נוּ הַשֵּׁ֥את וְהַשָּֽׁבֶר׃ {ס}        
Fear and, [(when we fled from it,)] the pit [(into which we fell)] are come upon us, the desolation and the breaking.

פַּלְגֵי־מַ֙יִם֙ תֵּרַ֣ד עֵינִ֔י עַל־שֶׁ֖בֶר בַּת־עַמִּֽי׃ {ס}        
Streams of water shall my eye shed over the destruction of the daughter of my people.

עֵינִ֧י נִגְּרָ֛ה וְלֹ֥א תִדְמֶ֖ה מֵאֵ֥ין הֲפֻגֽוֹת׃ {ס}        
My eye shall flow and not be still, without surcease,

עַד־יַשְׁקִ֣יף וְיֵ֔רֶא יְהֹוָ֖ה מִשָּׁמָֽיִם׃ {ס}        
until the L-rd look and behold from heaven.

עֵינִי֙ עֽוֹלְלָ֣ה לְנַפְשִׁ֔י מִכֹּ֖ל בְּנ֥וֹת עִירִֽי׃ {ס}        
My eye has disfigured my face [with ceaseless weeping] more than all the daughters [i.e., the families] of my city [(my priestly family having been elected above all of Israel for sacred service)].

צ֥וֹד צָד֛וּנִי כַּצִּפּ֖וֹר אֹיְבַ֥י חִנָּֽם׃ {ס}        
They hunted me as a bird, my foes — in vain.

צָֽמְת֤וּ בַבּוֹר֙ חַיָּ֔י וַיַּדּוּ־אֶ֖בֶן בִּֽי׃ {ס}        
They bound my life in the pit [(in the prison-house)], and [(that not sufficing them)] cast a stone upon me.

צָֽפוּ־מַ֥יִם עַל־רֹאשִׁ֖י אָמַ֥רְתִּי נִגְזָֽרְתִּי׃ {ס}        
Waters flowed over my head; I said: I am cut off [(from life)].

קָרָ֤אתִי שִׁמְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֔ה מִבּ֖וֹר תַּחְתִּיּֽוֹת׃ {ס}        
I called Your name, O L-rd, from the nethermost pit.

קוֹלִ֖י שָׁמָ֑עְתָּ אַל־תַּעְלֵ֧ם אׇזְנְךָ֛ לְרַוְחָתִ֖י לְשַׁוְעָתִֽי׃ {ס}        
You heard my voice; deaden not Your ear to my sigh, to my cry.

קָרַ֙בְתָּ֙ בְּי֣וֹם אֶקְרָאֶ֔ךָּ אָמַ֖רְתָּ אַל־תִּירָֽא׃ {ס}        
[(In the past)] You drew near on the day that I called You. You said: Do not fear.

רַ֧בְתָּ אֲדֹנָ֛י רִיבֵ֥י נַפְשִׁ֖י גָּאַ֥לְתָּ חַיָּֽי׃ {ס}        
[(In the past)] You battled, my L-rd, the battles of my soul; You redeemed my life.

רָאִ֤יתָה יְהֹוָה֙ עַוָּ֣תָתִ֔י שׇׁפְטָ֖ה מִשְׁפָּטִֽי׃ {ס}        
You have seen, O L-rd, how I am wronged. Judge my cause [(as You did in the past)].

רָאִ֙יתָה֙ כׇּל־נִקְמָתָ֔ם כׇּל־מַחְשְׁבֹתָ֖ם לִֽי׃ {ס}        
You have seen all their revenge, all their thoughts against me.

שָׁמַ֤עְתָּ חֶרְפָּתָם֙ יְהֹוָ֔ה כׇּל־מַחְשְׁבֹתָ֖ם עָלָֽי׃ {ס}        
You have heard their insults, O L-rd, all their thoughts against me,

שִׂפְתֵ֤י קָמַי֙ וְהֶגְיוֹנָ֔ם עָלַ֖י כׇּל־הַיּֽוֹם׃ {ס}        
the lips of those who rose against me, and their muttering against me all the day.

שִׁבְתָּ֤ם וְקִֽימָתָם֙ הַבִּ֔יטָה אֲנִ֖י מַנְגִּינָתָֽם׃ {ס}        
Behold their sitting down and their rising up — I am their song.

תָּשִׁ֨יב לָהֶ֥ם גְּמ֛וּל יְהֹוָ֖ה כְּמַעֲשֵׂ֥ה יְדֵיהֶֽם׃ {ס}        
Render them their recompense, O L-rd, according to the work of their hands.

תִּתֵּ֤ן לָהֶם֙ מְגִנַּת־לֵ֔ב תַּאֲלָֽתְךָ֖ לָהֶֽם׃ {ס}        
Give them breaking of heart; [cast] Your curse upon them!

תִּרְדֹּ֤ף בְּאַף֙ וְתַשְׁמִידֵ֔ם מִתַּ֖חַת שְׁמֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃ {פ}
Pursue (them) in wrath and wipe them out from under the heavens of the L-rd!


Chapter 4

אֵיכָה֙ יוּעַ֣ם זָהָ֔ב יִשְׁנֶ֖א הַכֶּ֣תֶם הַטּ֑וֹב תִּשְׁתַּפֵּ֙כְנָה֙ אַבְנֵי־קֹ֔דֶשׁ בְּרֹ֖אשׁ כׇּל־חוּצֽוֹת׃ {ס}        
How is the gold [(the face of King Yoshiyahu, which glowed like gold)] dulled! [How is] the fine gold transformed! [viz. Chronicles 35:25], the hallowed stones [(young men who shone like precious stones)] spilled out at the head of every street!

בְּנֵ֤י צִיּוֹן֙ הַיְקָרִ֔ים הַמְסֻלָּאִ֖ים בַּפָּ֑ז אֵיכָ֤ה נֶחְשְׁבוּ֙ לְנִבְלֵי־חֶ֔רֶשׂ מַעֲשֵׂ֖ה יְדֵ֥י יוֹצֵֽר׃ {ס}        
The precious sons of Zion, valued as fine gold — how are they become as earthen jugs, the work of the potter!

גַּם־[תַּנִּים֙] (תנין) חָ֣לְצוּ שַׁ֔ד הֵינִ֖יקוּ גּוּרֵיהֶ֑ן בַּת־עַמִּ֣י לְאַכְזָ֔ר (כי ענים) [כַּיְעֵינִ֖ים] בַּמִּדְבָּֽר׃ {ס}        
Even the jackals draw out the breast; they give suck to their young ones. The daughter of my people has become cruel [(They deafen themselves to the cries of their starving children to assuage their own hunger)], like ostriches in the wilderness.

דָּבַ֨ק לְשׁ֥וֹן יוֹנֵ֛ק אֶל־חִכּ֖וֹ בַּצָּמָ֑א עֽוֹלָלִים֙ שָׁ֣אֲלוּ לֶ֔חֶם פֹּרֵ֖שׂ אֵ֥ין לָהֶֽם׃ {ס}        
The tongue of the nursing child cleaves to its palate in thirst. Young children begged for bread. There is no one to break it for them.

הָאֹֽכְלִים֙ לְמַ֣עֲדַנִּ֔ים נָשַׁ֖מּוּ בַּחוּצ֑וֹת הָאֱמֻנִים֙ עֲלֵ֣י תוֹלָ֔ע חִבְּק֖וּ אַשְׁפַּתּֽוֹת׃ {ס}        
Those who were fed on delicacies expired in the streets. Those who were reared in scarlet embraced the dung hills.

וַיִּגְדַּל֙ עֲוֺ֣ן בַּת־עַמִּ֔י מֵֽחַטַּ֖את סְדֹ֑ם הַֽהֲפוּכָ֣ה כְמוֹ־רָ֔גַע וְלֹא־חָ֥לוּ בָ֖הּ יָדָֽיִם׃ {ס}        
And the transgression of the daughter of my people [(judging from the severity and duration of its punishment)] was greater than the sins of Sodom, which was overturned but in a moment, the hands [of enemies] not prevailing in her [(but those of angels)].

זַכּ֤וּ נְזִירֶ֙יהָ֙ מִשֶּׁ֔לֶג צַח֖וּ מֵחָלָ֑ב אָ֤דְמוּ עֶ֙צֶם֙ מִפְּנִינִ֔ים סַפִּ֖יר גִּזְרָתָֽם׃ {ס}        
Her [(Jerusalem's)] Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk, ruddier than rubies, formed as the sapphire.

חָשַׁ֤ךְ מִשְּׁחוֹר֙ תׇּֽאֳרָ֔ם לֹ֥א נִכְּר֖וּ בַּחוּצ֑וֹת צָפַ֤ד עוֹרָם֙ עַל־עַצְמָ֔ם יָבֵ֖שׁ הָיָ֥ה כָעֵֽץ׃ {ס}        
[But now,] darker than coal is their visage; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin is shriveled upon them; it has become dry as a stick.

טוֹבִ֤ים הָיוּ֙ חַלְלֵי־חֶ֔רֶב מֵֽחַלְלֵ֖י רָעָ֑ב שֶׁ֣הֵ֤ם יָזֻ֙בוּ֙ מְדֻקָּרִ֔ים מִתְּנוּבֹ֖ת שָׂדָֽי׃ {ס}        
More fortunate were those slain by the sword than those slain by hunger. For they [(the latter)] oozed [excrement] when [their bellies] split [(from hunger and)] from the fruits of the field [i.e., from the roots and grasses that they were forced to subsist on].

יְדֵ֗י נָשִׁים֙ רַחֲמָ֣נִיּ֔וֹת בִּשְּׁל֖וּ יַלְדֵיהֶ֑ן הָי֤וּ לְבָרוֹת֙ לָ֔מוֹ בְּשֶׁ֖בֶר בַּת־עַמִּֽי׃ {ס}        
The hands of merciful women boiled their children. They were a meal to them in the breaking of the daughter of my people.

כִּלָּ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־חֲמָת֔וֹ שָׁפַ֖ךְ חֲר֣וֹן אַפּ֑וֹ וַיַּצֶּת־אֵ֣שׁ בְּצִיּ֔וֹן וַתֹּ֖אכַל יְסֹדֹתֶֽיהָ׃ {ס}        
The L-rd has consummated His wrath [(which burned in Him for many years)]. He has poured out His burning wrath. And He has kindled a fire in Zion, which has consumed her foundations.

לֹ֤א הֶאֱמִ֙ינוּ֙ מַלְכֵי־אֶ֔רֶץ (וכל) [כֹּ֖ל] יֹשְׁבֵ֣י תֵבֵ֑ל כִּ֤י יָבֹא֙ צַ֣ר וְאוֹיֵ֔ב בְּשַׁעֲרֵ֖י יְרוּשָׁלָֽ͏ִם׃ {ס}        
The kings of the earth could not believe, and all the inhabitants of the world, that the oppressor and the foe could enter the gates of Jerusalem.

מֵֽחַטֹּ֣אות נְבִיאֶ֔יהָ עֲוֺנֹ֖ת כֹּהֲנֶ֑יהָ הַשֹּׁפְכִ֥ים בְּקִרְבָּ֖הּ דַּ֥ם צַדִּיקִֽים׃ {ס}        
Because of the sins of her prophets, the transgressions of her priests, the spilling in her midst of the blood of the righteous.

נָע֤וּ עִוְרִים֙ בַּֽחוּצ֔וֹת נְגֹֽאֲל֖וּ בַּדָּ֑ם בְּלֹ֣א יֽוּכְל֔וּ יִגְּע֖וּ בִּלְבֻשֵׁיהֶֽם׃ {ס}        
The blind wandered in the streets, smeared with the blood [(of the slain, on which they slipped)]. [Their kin,] being unable to touch their garments —

ס֣וּרוּ טָמֵ֞א קָ֣רְאוּ לָ֗מוֹ ס֤וּרוּ ס֙וּרוּ֙ אַל־תִּגָּ֔עוּ כִּ֥י נָצ֖וּ גַּם־נָ֑עוּ אָֽמְרוּ֙ בַּגּוֹיִ֔ם לֹ֥א יוֹסִ֖פוּ לָגֽוּר׃ {ס}        
Away! unclean ones, they cried out to them. Away! Away! do not touch. For they were befouled; they had also slipped [on the blood]. They said among the nations: They will not continue to live [here].

פְּנֵ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ חִלְּקָ֔ם לֹ֥א יוֹסִ֖יף לְהַבִּיטָ֑ם פְּנֵ֤י כֹהֲנִים֙ לֹ֣א נָשָׂ֔אוּ (זקנים) [וּזְקֵנִ֖ים] לֹ֥א חָנָֽנוּ׃ {ס}        
The face [(of wrath)] of the L-rd has divided them [(among the nations)]. He will look on them no more, [for] they did not respect the priests; they were not gracious to the elders [(when they were at peace)].

(עודינה) [עוֹדֵ֙ינוּ֙] תִּכְלֶ֣ינָה עֵינֵ֔ינוּ אֶל־עֶזְרָתֵ֖נוּ הָ֑בֶל בְּצִפִּיָּתֵ֣נוּ צִפִּ֔ינוּ אֶל־גּ֖וֹי לֹ֥א יוֹשִֽׁעַ׃ {ס}        
[When the evil came upon us,] our eyes yet looked out for our vain help [(Egypt)], keeping a watch for a nation that would not save.

צָד֣וּ צְעָדֵ֔ינוּ מִלֶּ֖כֶת בִּרְחֹבֹתֵ֑ינוּ קָרַ֥ב קִצֵּ֛נוּ מָלְא֥וּ יָמֵ֖ינוּ כִּי־בָ֥א קִצֵּֽנוּ׃ {ס}        
They [(our enemies)] spied out our steps against walking in our broad places. Our end has drawn near. Our days have run full, for our end has come.

קַלִּ֤ים הָיוּ֙ רֹדְפֵ֔ינוּ מִנִּשְׁרֵ֖י שָׁמָ֑יִם עַל־הֶהָרִ֣ים דְּלָקֻ֔נוּ בַּמִּדְבָּ֖ר אָ֥רְבוּ לָֽנוּ׃ {ס}        
Swifter were our pursuers than the eagles in the heavens. On the mountains they chased us; in the desert they lay in wait for us.

ר֤וּחַ אַפֵּ֙ינוּ֙ מְשִׁ֣יחַ יְהֹוָ֔ה נִלְכַּ֖ד בִּשְׁחִיתוֹתָ֑ם אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָמַ֔רְנוּ בְּצִלּ֖וֹ נִֽחְיֶ֥ה בַגּוֹיִֽם׃ {ס}        
The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the L-rd [(King Yoshiyahu, viz. II Chronicles 35:25)] was caught in their pits — he of whom we said: Under his [(protective)] shadow shall we live among the nations.

שִׂ֤ישִׂי וְשִׂמְחִי֙ בַּת־אֱד֔וֹם (יושבתי) [יוֹשֶׁ֖בֶת] בְּאֶ֣רֶץ ע֑וּץ גַּם־עָלַ֙יִךְ֙ תַּעֲבׇר־כּ֔וֹס תִּשְׁכְּרִ֖י וְתִתְעָרִֽי׃ {ס}        
[(Jeremiah now prophesies the destruction of the second Temple by the Romans:)] Rejoice and regale, O daughter of Edom, dweller in the land of Utz, [but] over you, too, will pass the cup [(of punishment)]. You will become drunk [on it] and vomit [it up]!

תַּם־עֲוֺנֵךְ֙ בַּת־צִיּ֔וֹן לֹ֥א יוֹסִ֖יף לְהַגְלוֹתֵ֑ךְ פָּקַ֤ד עֲוֺנֵךְ֙ בַּת־אֱד֔וֹם גִּלָּ֖ה עַל־חַטֹּאתָֽיִךְ׃ {פ}
Your transgression is ended, O daughter of Zion [i.e., you have been punished for all of your sins]; He will exile you no more — He has remembered your transgression, O daughter of Edom; He has bared all of your sins [(for punishment)].


Chapter 5

זְכֹ֤ר יְהֹוָה֙ מֶֽה־הָ֣יָה לָ֔נוּ (הביט) [הַבִּ֖יטָה] וּרְאֵ֥ה אֶת־חֶרְפָּתֵֽנוּ׃
Remember, O L-rd, what has become of us. Look, and behold our shame.

נַחֲלָתֵ֙נוּ֙ נֶֽהֶפְכָ֣ה לְזָרִ֔ים בָּתֵּ֖ינוּ לְנׇכְרִֽים׃
Our inheritance has been overturned by foreigners; our houses, by strangers.

יְתוֹמִ֤ים הָיִ֙ינוּ֙ (אין) [וְאֵ֣ין] אָ֔ב אִמֹּתֵ֖ינוּ כְּאַלְמָנֽוֹת׃
We are as orphans, without a father; our mothers, as widows.

מֵימֵ֙ינוּ֙ בְּכֶ֣סֶף שָׁתִ֔ינוּ עֵצֵ֖ינוּ בִּמְחִ֥יר יָבֹֽאוּ׃
[(Fearing to draw water from the river lest we be attacked by our foes,)] we drank our water for money [i.e., we bought it from them]; our wood was sold to us.

עַ֤ל צַוָּארֵ֙נוּ֙ נִרְדָּ֔פְנוּ יָגַ֖עְנוּ (לא) [וְלֹ֥א] הֽוּנַֽח־לָֽנוּ׃
We were pursued [with the yoke of hard labor] on our necks. We wearied ourselves [(to earn something)], but it [(what we earned)] was not left with us [(but exacted in taxes)].

מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ נָתַ֣נּוּ יָ֔ד אַשּׁ֖וּר לִשְׂבֹּ֥עַֽ לָֽחֶם׃
[To] Egypt we stretched out a hand [(to support ourselves on them)]; [to] Ashur, to be sated with [their] bread.

אֲבֹתֵ֤ינוּ חָֽטְאוּ֙ (אינם) [וְאֵינָ֔ם] (אנחנו) [וַאֲנַ֖חְנוּ] עֲוֺנֹתֵיהֶ֥ם סָבָֽלְנוּ׃
Our fathers sinned and are no more, and we have borne their sins.

עֲבָדִים֙ מָ֣שְׁלוּ בָ֔נוּ פֹּרֵ֖ק אֵ֥ין מִיָּדָֽם׃
Slaves ruled over us; there is no redeemer from their hand.

בְּנַפְשֵׁ֙נוּ֙ נָבִ֣יא לַחְמֵ֔נוּ מִפְּנֵ֖י חֶ֥רֶב הַמִּדְבָּֽר׃
At [the risk of] our lives we brought our bread, because of the sword of [marauders in] the wilderness.

עוֹרֵ֙נוּ֙ כְּתַנּ֣וּר נִכְמָ֔רוּ מִפְּנֵ֖י זַלְעֲפ֥וֹת רָעָֽב׃
Our skin as [(in)] an oven was parched, because of the burning famine.

נָשִׁים֙ בְּצִיּ֣וֹן עִנּ֔וּ בְּתֻלֹ֖ת בְּעָרֵ֥י יְהוּדָֽה׃
Women in Zion they ravished; virgins in the cities of Judah.

שָׂרִים֙ בְּיָדָ֣ם נִתְל֔וּ פְּנֵ֥י זְקֵנִ֖ים לֹ֥א נֶהְדָּֽרוּ׃
Princes they hanged by their hands; they showed no deference for elders.

בַּחוּרִים֙ טְח֣וֹן נָשָׂ֔אוּ וּנְעָרִ֖ים בָּעֵ֥ץ כָּשָֽׁלוּ׃
Young men carried millstones [(on their shoulders to weary them when they were being led in chains)]; youths were weakened by [burdens of] wood.

זְקֵנִים֙ מִשַּׁ֣עַר שָׁבָ֔תוּ בַּחוּרִ֖ים מִנְּגִינָתָֽם׃
Elders have ceased form the gate; young men from their song.

שָׁבַת֙ מְשׂ֣וֹשׂ לִבֵּ֔נוּ נֶהְפַּ֥ךְ לְאֵ֖בֶל מְחֹלֵֽנוּ׃
The joy of our heart has ceased; our dance turned to mourning.

נָֽפְלָה֙ עֲטֶ֣רֶת רֹאשֵׁ֔נוּ אֽוֹי־נָ֥א לָ֖נוּ כִּ֥י חָטָֽאנוּ׃
The crown of our head is fallen — Woe unto us, for we have sinned!

עַל־זֶ֗ה הָיָ֤ה דָוֶה֙ לִבֵּ֔נוּ עַל־אֵ֖לֶּה חָשְׁכ֥וּ עֵינֵֽינוּ׃
For this [(what follows)] our heart was afflicted; for these our eyes were darkened:

עַ֤ל הַר־צִיּוֹן֙ שֶׁשָּׁמֵ֔ם שׁוּעָלִ֖ים הִלְּכוּ־בֽוֹ׃ {פ}
For Mount Zion, which is desolate; foxes prowl on it.

אַתָּ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ לְעוֹלָ֣ם תֵּשֵׁ֔ב כִּסְאֲךָ֖ לְד֥וֹר וָדֽוֹר׃
[But] You, O L-rd, forever shall preside; Your throne, from generation to generation.

לָ֤מָּה לָנֶ֙צַח֙ תִּשְׁכָּחֵ֔נוּ תַּֽעַזְבֵ֖נוּ לְאֹ֥רֶךְ יָמִֽים׃
Why [then] should You forget us eternally, forsake us everlastingly? [(Did You not swear to us [to preserve us] by Your everlasting Presence?)]

הֲשִׁיבֵ֨נוּ יְהֹוָ֤ה ׀ אֵלֶ֙יךָ֙ (ונשוב) [וְֽנָשׁ֔וּבָה] חַדֵּ֥שׁ יָמֵ֖ינוּ כְּקֶֽדֶם׃
Return us, O L-rd, to You, and we shall return; renew our days as of yore.

כִּ֚י אִם־מָאֹ֣ס מְאַסְתָּ֔נוּ קָצַ֥פְתָּ עָלֵ֖ינוּ עַד־מְאֹֽד׃
השיבנו יהוה אליך ונשובה חדש ימינו כקדם
For though You have deeply despised us [for our sins], You were overly wrathful with us.
