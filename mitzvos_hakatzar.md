### 1. Belief in God
.**אָֽנֹכִ֖י֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑֔יךָ** אֲשֶׁ֧ר הוֹצֵאתִ֛יךָ מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם מִבֵּ֣֥ית עֲבָדִֽ֑ים

Shemos 20:2

- God created and controls everything. 
- Someone who denies this is renouncing his Judaism. 
- It is better to die than deny this principle.
--- 

### 2. Oneness of God 
.שְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ **יְהוָ֥ה ׀ אֶחָֽד**

Devarim 6:4

- There are not multiple gods.
- God is not comprised of parts.
- God has no physical form. 
--- 
### 3. Loving God 
**.וְאָ֣הַבְתָּ֔ אֵ֖ת יְהוָ֣ה** אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ בְּכָל־לְבָבְךָ֥ וּבְכָל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖ וּבְכָל־מְאֹדֶֽךָ

Devarim 6:5

- Think about what God does, then your heart will burn with love for Him. 
- The more you understand God, the more you will love Him.
- You should learn fields of wisdom that will inspire you to love Him more. For example,  astronomy, zoology, etc. 
- As part of your love for God, you should influence others to be loyal to Him. 
Avraham did this, and that is why he is called the beloved one of Hashem.
--- 
### 4. Fearing God 
**אֶת־יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ תִּירָ֖א** וְאֹת֣וֹ תַעֲבֹ֑ד וּבִשְׁמ֖וֹ תִּשָּׁבֵֽעַ׃

Devarim 6:13
- Come to fear of God by thinking about his actions, exactly what brings you to love Him.
- When you have an opportunity to do a sin, you must focus on the fact that God is watching you right now. 
- The prohibition to mention God's name in vain is part of fearing God.
--- 
### 5. Sanctifying God's name in public
וְלֹ֤א תְחַלְּלוּ֙ אֶת־שֵׁ֣ם קָדְשִׁ֔י **וְנִ֨קְדַּשְׁתִּ֔י בְּת֖וֹךְ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל** אֲנִ֥י יְהוָ֖ה מְקַדִּשְׁכֶֽם׃

Vayikra 22:32

- We have to be willing to give up our life, to publicize our loyalty to God.
- If a villain is trying to make you give up Judaism, you are not allowed to simply mislead him into thinking that you're denouncing God, even if really in your heart you're remaining totally loyal. 
- If the villain is trying to make you give up Judaism, and this is being done in public, which means in the presence of ten Jews, then even for any mitzvah even if there is no decree "shmad" to wipe out Torah, you should not violate the mitzvah, but rather die.
- If it is a time of shmad, then even in private, one must give up their life.
- But for the big three averos -- namely: idolatry, immorality, and murder -- you have to give up your life rather than sin, even in private, and even if it is not a time of shmad, and even if the villain is motivated by personal reasons without any interest in making you give up Torah.
- Anyone who fails to do this, has neglected the positive mitzvah of kidush Hashem and has also violated the negative mitzvah of descecrating Hashem's name.
---
## 6. To Walk in God's Ways
יְקִֽימְךָ֨ יְהוָ֥ה לוֹ֙ לְעַ֣ם קָד֔וֹשׁ כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר נִֽשְׁבַּֽע־לָ֑ךְ כִּ֣י תִשְׁמֹ֗ר אֶת־מִצְוֺת֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ **וְהָלַכְתָּ֖ בִּדְרָכָֽיו**׃

Devarim 28:9
-  Just as God is kind and shows mercy, so too we should be kind and show mercy. 
- Any quality that is attributed to God -- anthropomorphically, of course -- we should emulate.
---
## 7. Prayer
אֶת־יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ תִּירָ֖א **וְאֹת֣וֹ תַעֲבֹ֑ד** וּבִשְׁמ֖וֹ תִּשָּׁבֵֽעַ׃
- We know this service refers to prayer because there is another posuk (in the second parsha of krias Shema) that says we should serve God will all our heart. Service done with the heart is prayer.
- This mitzvah has three parts: first, to praise God; second, to ask Him for what you need; and third, to praise Him and thank Him. 
- When you daven, you should empty your mind of any distacting thoughts, and picture yourself standing in the presence of God.
- Do not pray like you are just trying to get the burden over with. Also, don't pray with thoughts preoccupying you. 
- Men and women are both obligated to pray.

## Tefillin on the Arm
**וּקְשַׁרְתָּ֥ם לְא֖וֹת עַל־יָדֶ֑ךָ** וְהָי֥וּ לְטֹטָפֹ֖ת בֵּ֥ין עֵינֶֽיךָ׃

Devarim 6:8
- The place to put the tefilin on your arm is on the bicep where the flesh bulges.
---
## Tefillin on your Head
וּקְשַׁרְתָּ֥ם לְא֖וֹת עַל־יָדֶ֑ךָ **וְהָי֥וּ לְטֹטָפֹ֖ת בֵּ֥ין עֵינֶֽיךָ**׃
- The place where it goes on your head is where a baby's skin is soft.
- There are four paragraphs from the Torah written on the parchments: 
    - *Kadesh* and *Vihaya Ki Yeviacha* -- both from parshas Bo -- which discuss Hashem taking us from Egypt to be Hi servants; and 
    - *Shema* (from parshas Vaeschanan) and *Vehaya Im Shamoa* (from parshas Eikev) which discuss a person's commitment to God and to keeping His laws.
- In the arm tefillin the parshios are on one parchment, but in the head tefillin they are each placed into four small separate compartments.
- Someone who doesn't wear tefilin is violating *eight* mitzvos. Since each parsha is a mitzva unto itself, and there are four parshios for both the arm and the head (4 x 2 = 8). 
- One's body shouldn't be unclean -- i.e. passing gas -- while wearing tefillin.
- Someone who recites krias shema without wearing tefillin is like giving false testimony about himself.
    - Rashi says that it means the false testimony against Hashem. The language "against yourself" is just a euphemism. 
- The navi Yeshaya (38:16) tells us "God is upon them, they will live", which teaches us the segula that someone who does wear tefillin with a clean body will merit long life.
- You should constantly be touching your tefillin when you wear them, so as not to take your attention off them. 
Another segula from wearing tefillin is that you will be humble and God fearing; you will not get caught up  in frivolity, naarishkeit, or sinful thoughts; instead you will focus on emes.
- Only men are commanded to wear tefilin. Women are not. 
    - Unlike shofar or lulav, which women are rewarded for fulfilling, tefillin is different. Since there is a risk of wearing it while the body is unclean, it is not recommended for women. 
---
## 10. Tzitzis
דַּבֵּ֞ר אֶל־בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ וְאָמַרְתָּ֣ אֲלֵהֶ֔ם **וְעָשׂ֨וּ לָהֶ֥ם צִיצִ֛ת עַל־כַּנְפֵ֥י בִגְדֵיהֶ֖ם** לְדֹרֹתָ֑ם וְנָֽתְנ֛וּ עַל־צִיצִ֥ת הַכָּנָ֖ף פְּתִ֥יל תְּכֵֽלֶת׃

Bamidbar 15:38
Tzitzis applies only to clothing that meets certain conditons: 
- The garment is for daytime, not just nightime. 
- The garment must have four corners, or more.
- The garment must be large enough to cover most of the body of a child who is old enough to walk out on the street unsupervised.
- The Torah obligation only applies to garments made from wool or made from linen. Cotton, silk, polyester, or any other materials are only obligated mid'rabanan. 
- If you wear such a garment and it is does not have proper tzitzis, then you are violating this positive mitzva.
- Once a child is old enough to know how to wear a pair of tzitzis, then he is obliged mid'rabanan to wear tzitzis. 
- one should be especially careful with the mitzva of tzitzis because it is equated to all the mitzvos (Bemidbar 15:39): *"You should look at [the tzitzis] and remember all God's commandments"*. 
- This mitzva applies all the time. 
    - According to the Rambam, the mitzva doesn't apply at night, but according to the Rosh it does. 
- Only men have to wear tzitzis; women do not. 
     - Like tefillin, women are not enouraged to wear a tallis. Here though, it is not a problem of having an unclean body. Rather, it is one of two issues: 
        - According to the Targum Yonasan ben Uziel it is a violation of wearing garments of the opposite gender. 
        - According to others, it is a problem of yuhara. That is, because even a man is not obligated to wear tzitzis. So for a woman who is even less obligated, for her to wear tzitzis would perhaps give off the arrogant impression that she already fulfills all her necessary obligations, and therefore she wants to go above and beyond to wear tzitzis which she has no obligation whatsoever to wear. However this rationale is troubling, for two reasons.
            - First, even men are not technically obliged in tzitzis, unless they choose to wear a four cornered garment. So why should women be discouraged and men not?
            - Second, according to this logic, if a woman really is keeping all the laws of the Torah, then she would be fit to wear a tallis. 
## 11. Krias Shema
וְשִׁנַּנְתָּ֣ם לְבָנֶ֔יךָ **וְדִבַּרְתָּ֖ בָּ֑ם** בְּשִׁבְתְּךָ֤ בְּבֵיתֶ֙ךָ֙ וּבְלֶכְתְּךָ֣ בַדֶּ֔רֶךְ **וּֽבְשָׁכְבְּךָ֖ וּבְקוּמֶֽךָ**׃

Devarim 6:7
- The time for this mitzvah is when before bedtime after getting up in the morning.
- One should read all three parshios: 
    - *Shema*. This portion contains: our declaration that God is one; our obligation to love God; as well as the all important task of Torah study. 
    - *Vehaya Im Shamoa*. This contains are acceptance of all other mitzvos. 
    - *Vayomer*. This is the parsha about tzitzis, which contains our obligation to remember all the mitzvos, and declares the fact that God took us out from Egypt which we learn from the verse in Devarim 16:3 

- This obligation only applies to men, not women. 
    - In fact, women are generally exempt from time bound positive mitzvos. This is a principle we learn from tefillin actually. 
    - Why? Some say -- I think the Abudraham -- because they are too busy taking care of the needs of the household. 
    - Where do we learn this exemption from?
    - There are three basic exceptions to this rule:
        1. Matzah - Since they are forbidden to eat 
        1. Hakhel - All men women and even children come once every seven years to hear the king read the Torah. 
        1. Simchas Yom Tov - Women should receive something, such as a new outfit, from their husbands for Yom Tov. 
        - Kiddush for Shabbos - Arguably this is another case where women are obligated even though it is a time bound positive mitzvah. 
        - Women are also obligated in some mitzvos d'rabanan -- ner chanuka, krias hamegila, and 4 cups at the seder -- because they were involved in God's miraculous salvation of the Jewish people. According to Rashi, it is because they were the main vehicle for the miracle: Yehudis who slew Eliporni, Queen Esther, and the righteous women in Egypt.  
        - Kiddush for Shabbos - Arguably this is another case where women are obligated even though it is a time bound positive mitzvah. The basis for their obligation is that since they are obliged to not do melacha, and zachor (kiddush) is connected with shamor (isur melacha), therefore they must hear kiddush as well. 

## 12. Mezuza
וּכְתַבְתָּם עַל־**מְזוּזֹת** בֵּיתֶךָ וּבִשְׁעָרֶיךָ׃ 

Devarim 6:9
- We should affix a mezuza to the doorposts of our home. 
- There are two paragraphs in the mezuza: #1 Shema and #2 Vehaya im shamoa. These are the same as the last two portions that are written in tefillin -- see mitzvos 8 and 9.
- The purpose of the mezuza is that whenever we go in or out of our house, we will be reminded that God is one, and we will recall the great love that we should have toward Him. We will rouse ourselves to wake up from the vain pursuits of this world, and focus on the fact that nothing lasts forever, except our knowledge of God. That way, when we go about our daily affairs, we will do so with proper focus, always acting with integrity.
- This obligation falls upon women just as equally as men. The Gemara suggests that since mezuza is mentioned next to tefillin in the Chumash, so therefore only men have to keep it. But that thought is rejected. 


## 13. Mezuza
וְאָכַלְתָּ וְשָׂבָעְתָּ **וּבֵרַכְתָּ** אֶת־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ עַל־הָאָרֶץ הַטֹּבָה אֲשֶׁר נָתַן־לָךְ׃

Devarim 6:9

**On what foods do we recite birkas hamazon?**


We should recite birkas hamazon after eating bread.


**On what foods do we recite birkas hamazon?**

We should recite birkas hamazon after eating bread.

- We should recite birkas hamazon after eating bread.
- The Torah obligation is only if I eat so much that I am satiated. 
- But Chazal ruled that we should bensch even if we only ate the volume of a kezayis. That is one half -- or some say one third -- the size of an egg. Opinions differ if we should use ~30 cc, based on the size of a modern day egg, or must we use a larger value 50 cc, since it can be argued that the size of eggs has shrunk.  
- Before eating we also must make a bracha. This is based on a kal v'chomer argument: If when we are already satisfied we need to express gratitude to Hashem, so then when are hungry and feel need how more so!
- The obligation for women to bensch is doubtful whether it is Torah or rabbinic. This is a Gemara in Berachos. 
    - What is the reason they should be exempt? This is not a time bound mitzvah! Rashi says because women do not inherit a portion in Israel. Tosfos points out this is not so, e.g. the daughters of Tzelofchad; rather the reason to exempt women would be because the second bracha mentions bris milah and Torah which do not apply to a woman.

## 14. Learning and Teaching Torah
**וְשִׁנַּנְתָּם לְבָנֶיךָ** וְדִבַּרְתָּ בָּם בְּשִׁבְתְּךָ בְּבֵיתֶךָ וּבְלֶכְתְּךָ בַדֶּרֶךְ וּבְשָׁכְבְּךָ וּבְקוּמֶךָ׃

Devarim 6:7
- The laws of the Torah should be clear and precise to you, so whenever you are asked you know clearly what to answer.
- Everyone -- whether rich or poor, young or old, sick or healthy -- must fix a time to learn both in the day and at night.
    - This is based on the posuk in Yehoshua: 

        לֹא־יָמוּשׁ סֵפֶר הַתּוֹרָה הַזֶּה מִפִּיךָ **וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה** לְמַעַן תִּשְׁמֹר לַעֲשׂוֹת כְּכָל־הַכָּתוּב בּוֹ כִּי־אָז תַּצְלִיחַ אֶת־דְּרָכֶךָ וְאָז תַּשְׂכִּיל׃

        There are two interpreations of the word "וְהָגִיתָ".
        Some say it means to think. On this basis the Vilna Gaon proves justifies reciting birkas hatorah before merely thinking in learning. Others, however, say that it means davka to speak. For example, Ramchal teaches that merely reciting the pesukim of Tanach -- even without understanding -- is a fulfillment of the mitzvah of Talmud Torah. 
- The obligation to learn continues even until the day of death. We learn this from the posuk:

    רַק הִשָּׁמֶר לְךָ וּשְׁמֹר נַפְשְׁךָ מְאֹד פֶּן־תִּשְׁכַּח אֶת־הַדְּבָרִים אֲשֶׁר־רָאוּ עֵינֶיךָ **וּפֶן־יָסוּרוּ מִלְּבָבְךָ כֹּל יְמֵי חַיֶּיךָ** וְהוֹדַעְתָּם לְבָנֶיךָ וְלִבְנֵי בָנֶיךָ׃

There was a man once who was dying and decided to learn while walking, because he wanted to fulfill this point of learning while walking even until the day of his death.
- A father must learn with his son, and that take priority over learning with others. 
- A grandfather must learn with his grandson, too. We learn this from the posuk:

    רַק הִשָּׁמֶר לְךָ וּשְׁמֹר נַפְשְׁךָ מְאֹד פֶּן־תִּשְׁכַּח אֶת־הַדְּבָרִים אֲשֶׁר־רָאוּ עֵינֶיךָ וּפֶן־יָסוּרוּ מִלְּבָבְךָ כֹּל יְמֵי חַיֶּיךָ **וְהוֹדַעְתָּם לְבָנֶיךָ וְלִבְנֵי בָנֶיךָ**׃
- When your child starts to be able to talk, you should teach him to say

    "תורה צוה לנו משה"
    
    (דברים לג, ד)


- You must hire a tutor to teach your son Torah. 
- A woman is exempt from learning or teaching Torah. But still she should make an effort for her children not grow to be ignorant.
- On a scale, Torah is equal in weight to all of the mitzvos. 
    - (It is a question if that means all *other* 612 mitzvos, or literally *all* the mitzvos including Talmusd Torah.) 
    - Why? Because learning will bring you to do the mitzvos. Why is that? Three reasons: 
    1. You will know what laws to keep. 
    2. You will be busy learning and thus too busy to get drawn after the yetzer hara. 
    3. You will learn the harsh punishments for all the sins, and thus be motivated to not transgress any of them. 

## 15. Writing a Sefer Torah

וְעַתָּ֗ה **כִּתְב֤וּ לָכֶם֙ אֶת־הַשִּׁירָ֣ה הַזֹּ֔את** וְלַמְּדָ֥הּ אֶת־בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל שִׂימָ֣הּ בְּפִיהֶ֑ם לְמַ֨עַן תִּהְיֶה־לִּ֜י הַשִּׁירָ֥ה הַזֹּ֛את לְעֵ֖ד בִּבְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃

Devarim 31:19

- Every Jew must write a sefer Torah.
- The above verse obliges us to write the song of Haazinu. But we cannot write just one portion of the Torah without writing all of it. Therefore, we must write the entire Torah, which includes the song of Haazinu. 
- If you do write it, then it is considered as if you recevied the Torah from Har Sinai. 
- If you are not able to write one, then you shuold buy one or hire someone else to write one.
- Even if you inherited a sefer Torah as a family heirloom, still you have to write a new one yourself.
- If you write or fix one letter in a Torah scroll, then it is considered that you wrote the entire thing. 
- According to the Rosh, the classical version of this mitzvah - i.e. writing an actual Torah scroll - only applied in the old days when people used the scroll for learning. But nowadays, since we only leave the Torah scroll in the shul for public Torah readings from time to time, and when we actually learn we do it from books, so then the real mitzvah is for each person to buy books of Tanach and Shas and commentaries and Halacha, so that he should be able to learn the laws of the Torah. 
- Fortunate is someone who can actually manage to fulfill both versions of the mitzvah!    


## 16. Be Close to Torah Scholars

אֶת־יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ תִּירָ֖א אֹת֣וֹ תַעֲבֹ֑ד **וּב֣וֹ תִדְבָּ֔ק** וּבִשְׁמ֖וֹ תִּשָּׁבֵֽעַ׃

Devarim 10:20

- You have to stick close to Torah sages and their disciples, and that will be like you are clinging to Hashem himself.
- Therefore, you should marry the daughter of a Torah scholar.
- You should marry your daughter to a Torah scholar. 
- You should eat with Torah scholars.
- You should provide him benefit from your assets.
- You should be willing to sit at the dust of the feet of Torah scholars, and thirstily drink up their words.

## 17. Standing up for Senior Citizens and Honoring Torah Scholars

**מִפְּנֵ֤י שֵׂיבָה֙ תָּק֔וּם וְהָדַרְתָּ֖ פְּנֵ֣י זָקֵ֑ן** וְיָרֵ֥אתָ מֵּאֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ אֲנִ֥י יְהוָֽה׃

Kedoshim 19:32

- You must stand up when an older person -- even if he or she is not a wise man or woman -- when they walk by. 
- A child, even if he is a big Torah schoar, must stand up for an elderly person; but he doesn't have to fully rise -- just standing up partially to show deference to the older person is enough. 
- You must show honor to a "zaken", which means a Torah scholar, even if he is a young kid, you should stand up fully for him when he walks by.
- When should you stand? When he reaches within four amos -- about seven feet -- distance of you, until he passes by you.
- You also have to show honor to your Rav, even if you didn't learn most of your Torah knowledge from him. 
- A Rav does have the ability to mochel and forgo this honor, in which case you do not have to honor him. 
- It is a great sin to dishonor Torah scholars or to hate them.
- Anyone who shames a Torah scholar has no portion to the world to come. 

## 18. Fear the Mikdash

אֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַ֣י תִּשְׁמֹ֔רוּ **וּמִקְדָּשִׁ֖י תִּירָ֑אוּ** אֲנִ֖י יְהוָֽה׃

Kedoshim 19:30

Our shuls and batei midrashim are like a miniature Beis Hamikdash. 

This is base on a [posuk in Yechezkel](https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.11.16) 

*"I [God] have become a little sanctuary to the Jews scattered over the world."*

- Therefore inside a shul, you are not allowed to fool around too much or act with excessive levity. 
- Even idle talk should be done outside of the shul.
- Inside a shul, you should not conduct affairs of business, e.g. calculating amounts of money. 
- Even sleeping should not be done in a shul. There is an exception to this for someone who always learns in the shul day and night, so then it is like his home. He is allowed to sleep there. 
- The reason for all these restricitions is because the holiness, the sanctity and kedusha of a shul or beis medrash is very great. 


## 19. Make Kiddush on Shabbos

**זָכ֛וֹר֩** אֶת־י֥֨וֹם הַשַּׁבָּ֖֜ת **לְקַדְּשֽׁ֗וֹ**

Yisro 20:8

- You have to verbally declare the holiness of Shabbos. 
- This should be done when Shabbos comes in, at kiddush; and also when Shabbos goes out, at havdala.
- Chazal enacted that one should say these words over a cup of wine; on Friday night you can use bread as an alternative to wine. At havadala one can alternatively use *chamar medinah*, a prominent beverage.
- You are not allowed to eat or drink before hearing Kiddush or Havdala. Drinking water before havdala is OK.
- The Neviim added two mitzvos for us on Shabbos, one being *Oneg* pleasure, the other being *Kavod* honor. 
We learn this from the [verse in Yeshaya](https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.58.13): *If you call Shabbat a delight, the honored holy day of God, then you enjoy Divine blessing.*
- *Kavod*, honoring Shabbos, means taking a hot shower before hand, and getting dressed up in fine clean clothes.
- *Oneg*, pleasure, means you shuld eat good quality food and drink. 
- You have to eat three meals on Shabbos.
- The more you spend on the cost of your meals for Shabbos, the more praiseworthy you are. Still, this shuold be done wihtin reason, meaning according to your means. 
- Anyone who take pleasure in Shabbos, i.e. by eating fine food and drink, will receive a portion of unimlited bounds. God will grant your requests; and you will be free from being subjugated to the nations of the nations of the world.
- After Shabbos too, you shuold set the table nicely for a fourth meal. This being Melaveh Malka. All you have to eat is a kezayis of bread, i.e. half a slice.
- According to the opinion of Ramban, one can fulfill this mitzvah of remembering Shabbos even during the week. Just count the days of the week as they do in Eretz Yisrael: Sunday is Yom Rishon, the first day to Shabbos, Monday is Yom Sheni, etc. 
- Likewise, when you find a nice fish or chicken in the store, and you buy it, when you are purchasing it, say out loud that you are buying it for Shabbos. 

## 20. Cease from Melacha on Shabbos

שֵׁ֤שֶׁת יָמִים֙ תַּעֲשֶׂ֣ה מַעֲשֶׂ֔יךָ **וּבַיּ֥וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֖י תִּשְׁבֹּ֑ת** לְמַ֣עַן יָנ֗וּחַ שֽׁוֹרְךָ֙ וַחֲמֹרֶ֔ךָ וְיִנָּפֵ֥שׁ בֶּן־אֲמָתְךָ֖ וְהַגֵּֽר׃

Mishpatim 23:12

- Not only we, but also our animals must cease doing melacha on Shabbos.
- To tell a goy to do melacha for us is asur mid'rabanan. This is known as a shvus.
- This obligation to rest on Shabbos applies to men and women equally. Some say that it applies only to men, but not to women. I heard from Rav Shraga Feivel Zimmerman that according to Rav Elyashiv that is the reason why you might think that it is better for a woman to do melacha for a choleh on Shabbos, rather than a man, because she doesn't have an aseh of tishbos. The halacha of course is that any Jew, man or woman, can and must do work on Shabbos if the choleh needs it.

## 21. Rejoicing on Festivals

**וְשָׂמַחְתָּ֖ בְּחַגֶּ֑ךָ** אַתָּ֨ה וּבִנְךָ֤ וּבִתֶּ֙ךָ֙ וְעַבְדְּךָ֣ וַאֲמָתֶ֔ךָ וְהַלֵּוִ֗י וְהַגֵּ֛ר וְהַיָּת֥וֹם וְהָאַלְמָנָ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר בִּשְׁעָרֶֽיךָ׃

Re'eh 16:14

- When there was a Beis Hamikdash, the way we would perform this mitzvah of simcha is by bringing addtional korban chagigah known and shalmei simcha, besides the regular shalmei chagiga.

- Not only men, but women also are obliged to rejoice on Yom Tov. Some say that it isn't the woman who needs to be joyful per se, but rather her husband who is obliged to bring her joy, for instance by buying her clothing. Likewise, in the case of children, the father must make them happy, for example by giving them treats.

- Nowadays, that we don't have the korbanos metinoed above, we can only fulfill the mitzvah of simcha by eating meat and brinking wine. 

- Not only must the man of the house provide nice clothes for his wife and treats for his children, but it is also a mitzvah to bring joy to the needy. 

- If a person does provide for the poor, then the joy he creates at home is not a mitzvah, but rather he is just having a good time, which is really a shame, as the Navi Malachi (2:3) says: "I will fling manure on your face, the manure of your Yom Tov celebration."

- Granted, there is a mitzvah to rejoice by eating and drinking extra special on Yom Tov, nevertheless one should not carry on too much with jesting and levity, because that is frivolty for fools. And we are not commandeed just to be drunk and merry, but rather rejoicing over the mitzvah. And, as the Rambam writes, the joy over doing a mitzvah is a great accomplishment in the service of God.
