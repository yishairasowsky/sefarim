Devarim 6:5

- Think about what God does, then your heart will burn with love for Him. 
- The more you understand God, the more you will love Him.
- You should learn fields of wisdom that will inspire you to love Him more. For example,  astronomy, zoology, etc. 
- As part of your love for God, you should influence others to be loyal to Him. 
Avraham did this, and that is why he is called the beloved one of Hashem.

### 4. Fearing God 
**אֶת־יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ תִּירָ֖א** וְאֹת֣וֹ תַעֲבֹ֑ד וּבִשְׁמ֖וֹ תִּשָּׁבֵֽעַ׃

Devarim 6:13
- Come to fear of God by thinking about his actions, exactly what brings you to love Him.
- When you have an opportunity to do a sin, you must focus on the fact that God is watching you right now. 
- The prohibition to mention God's name in vain is part of fearing God.

### 5. Sanctifying God's name in public
וְלֹ֤א תְחַלְּלוּ֙ אֶת־שֵׁ֣ם קָדְשִׁ֔י **וְנִ֨קְדַּשְׁתִּ֔י בְּת֖וֹךְ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל** אֲנִ֥י יְהוָ֖ה מְקַדִּשְׁכֶֽם׃

Vayikra 22:32

- We have to be willing to give up our life, to publicize our loyalty to God.
- If a villain is trying to make you give up Judaism, you are not allowed to simply mislead him into thinking that you're denouncing God, even if really in your heart you're remaining totally loyal. 
- If the villain is trying to make you give up Judaism, and this is being done in public, which means in the presence of ten Jews, then even for any mitzvah even if there is no decree "shmad" to wipe out Torah, you should not violate the mitzvah, but rather die.
